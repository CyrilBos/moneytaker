# money_taker

Ludum Dare April 2019, the theme was "Money". I tried out "Flame", a game engine written with Skia, the rendering engine of Flutter.

My goal was to implement some real-time tactical RPG, with a mobile-first design. I wanted to tie user actions to swipes (towards enemy = attack, opposite direction = defend, ...) and planned to implement custom shapes recognition (circle, triangle, ...). 

I also tried out Krita & using a graphical tablet for the first time to create the player sprite, inspired by Darkest Dungeons' style.
